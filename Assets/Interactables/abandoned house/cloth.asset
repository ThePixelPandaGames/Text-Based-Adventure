  description: A bloodstained piece of cloth lies discarded on the creaky wooden
    floor.
  examinationDescription: The cloth appears to be torn from a larger piece, and the
    dark stains imply a tragic event. The bloodstains are old, but they still raise
    unsettling questions about the house's past. What could have caused such a gruesome
    sight?
