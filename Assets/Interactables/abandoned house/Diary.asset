  description: A tattered diary with frayed edges lies open on a dusty shelf.
  examinationDescription: The diary's pages are filled with handwritten entries.
    Most describe everyday life in the house, but some hint at strained relationships
    and mysterious occurrences. The final entry is abrupt and chilling, mentioning
    "dark shadows" and "whispers in the night."
