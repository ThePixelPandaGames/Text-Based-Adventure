  descriptionInLocation: Amaru's eyes shimmer with an age-old wisdom, reflecting
    the twinkling stars. They are often found seated on a moss-covered stone, surrounded
    by ancient tomes and scrolls. The wind carries their soft whispers, and their
    voice holds a hint of enigma. Their grizzled hair, flecked with silvery streaks,
    adds to the air of ancient knowledge.
