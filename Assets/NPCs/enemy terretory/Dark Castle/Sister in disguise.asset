  response: "Ah, it's been a long, winding road, hasn't it? I never thought I'd see
    your face again, but destiny has a wicked sense of humor. You were always the
    favored one, the one they protected. And here you stand, still basking in their
    precious light, unaware of what you truly are.\r\nYou see, I wasn't spared without
    reason. Oh no, they left me behind, thinking me weak and disposable. But the
    shadows... they offered me strength, power beyond imagination. I was never one
    for blind devotion or sentimentality. The darkness, the shadows\u2014they showed
    me the path to true might.\r\n\rNow, I serve a purpose greater than any you've
    known. I'll bring this world to its knees, and in the end, you'll have to make
    a choice. Will you join me in the shadows' embrace, wielding power beyond your
    wildest dreams? Or will you cling to the feeble light, forever in your precious
    innocence? To stop me, you'll have to cross the line, dear brother. You'll have
    to kill me. But you won't! Haha, because I, Ally, will be the ruler of the new
    world!"
