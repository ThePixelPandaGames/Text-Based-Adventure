  descriptionInLocation: Valeria stands among the dimly lit surroundings, her presence
    a beacon of hope in the underground keep. Her weathered face and determined eyes
    tell tales of battles fought and secrets uncovered. Clad in the attire of a revolutionary,
    she exudes both strength and resilience.

  response: You've been searching for answers, haven't you? I can sense your determination.
    The one you seek, the woman in charge of the shadows, she's not what she seems.
    There's a darkness within her, a power she's harnessed to control the shadows,
    but at great cost. I fear she's lost herself to it. Keep your wits about you,
    for the battle ahead will be tougher than you can imagine.
