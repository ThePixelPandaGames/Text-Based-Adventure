  descriptionInLocation: Elara, a once-happy resident of a peaceful village, now
    stands amidst the eerie shadows of the deep forest. Her life was torn apart when
    her husband was taken by the encroaching darkness, consumed by the very shadows
    she now studies. She holds knowledge of the ancient history and the creeping
    threats that loom over the forest.

  response: Gaze upon the heart of the forest, traveler. A time long past held our
    village in its warm embrace. Yet, the shadows crept in, and my husband was lost
    to their sinister grasp. Do you seek to uncover the truth behind our tales? Answer
    my riddle, and perhaps I shall share what I know.
