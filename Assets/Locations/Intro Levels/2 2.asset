  locationDescription: 'Aric''s words are solemn and foreboding. "It is time," he
    says, a phrase heavy with the weight of destiny. The time has come to find your
    sister, to face your past, to unveil the enigmatic shadows that obscure the truth.



    With
    bated breath, Aric gazes at you, awaiting your answer. His voice carries in the
    silence, for the moment has come for you to shape your own fate. "Tell me, which
    race do you belong to, and what name shall you be known by? Your adventure begins
    now."'
