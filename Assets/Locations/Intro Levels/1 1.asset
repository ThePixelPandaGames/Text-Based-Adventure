  locationDescription: It all began with a sinister eclipse, an event that defied
    the natural order. The sun, the eternal guardian of the realms, was devoured
    by a shadowy maw, casting the land into an abyss of despair. The world plunged
    into an eerie twilight, where sinister beings, known only as the Shadows, began
    to emerge from the void.
