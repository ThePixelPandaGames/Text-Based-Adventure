  locationDescription: 'You stand at the crossroads of your destiny, a tale waiting
    to be written. The world around you stirs with ancient whispers, and a grand
    adventure beckons. You are not yet a hero; you are but a protagonist in the making.

    

    As
    you take your first steps, the ethereal veil of the unknown lifts. Your journey
    begins in your modest home, a place that resonates with comforting familiarity.
    You are granted the honor of choosing your own path, your own race, and even
    your own name.'
