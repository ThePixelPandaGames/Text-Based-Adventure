  locationDescription: 'Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows, a mentor named
    Aric. He stands as a paragon of wisdom, a torchbearer of the journey you are
    about to embark upon. His eyes, wiser than the darkest tomes of history, lock
    onto your soul.



    Aric''s words are solemn and foreboding. "It is time,"
    he says, a phrase heavy with the weight of destiny. The time has come to find
    your sister, to face your past, to unveil the enigmatic shadows that obscure
    the truth.'
