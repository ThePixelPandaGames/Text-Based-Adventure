  locationDescription: "Before the crossroads of your destiny, before the whispers
    of ancient prophecies, there was a time of tranquility. The world was once a
    place of peace and hope, where the warmth of daylight embraced every corner,
    and the future held the promise of prosperity. But as with any great story, the
    calm was shattered by the relentless march of darkness.\r"
