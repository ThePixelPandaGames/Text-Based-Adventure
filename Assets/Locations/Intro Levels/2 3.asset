  locationDescription: "As the sun fades on the world we once knew, it's time for
    you to embark on your journey, my young hero. I am Aric, your mentor and guide
    in these shadowed lands. Before we take another step, there's something you must
    decide \u2013 your path and identity.\r\n\r\nIn this world, there are three ancient
    races, each tied to the elemental forces of nature: the Maw\xFCn, the Aliwen,
    and the Newen. You may choose one of these races, each bearing unique abilities
    and ties to the natural world."
