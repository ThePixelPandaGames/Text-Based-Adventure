  locationDescription: You find yourself in a perilous pass leading towards the volcanic
    heart of the land. The air is heavy with heat, and the ground beneath your feet
    is a mixture of craggy rocks and coarse, black sand. The looming presence of
    the volcano casts long shadows over the landscape, while occasional plumes of
    dark smoke drift ominously from the mountain's peaks. A sense of danger and adventure
    engulfs you as you venture deeper into this fiery domain.

    exitDescription: Turning around, you witness the ominous sight of the volcano's
      imposing presence. Its towering peaks seem to touch the sky, and the path leads
      you closer to the smoldering crater, offering a stark contrast between the
      fiery danger ahead and the cool relief behind.
