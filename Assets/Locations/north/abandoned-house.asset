  locationDescription: The abandoned house atop the High Mountains is a relic of
    exploration and solitude. Worn wooden beams crisscross the dimly lit space, while
    aged maps and frayed documents scatter the room. The stories etched into the
    walls here are a testament to the explorer's journeys and quests for the unknown.
    Each creaking floorboard and faded journal page carries secrets that hint at
    the adventures of the past.

    exitDescription: Leaving the gloomy interior of the abandoned house, you find
      yourself back at the entrance of the dilapidated structure. The towering peaks
      of the high mountains loom over you as you make your way back to the mountain
      trail.
