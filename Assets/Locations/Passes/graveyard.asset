  locationDescription: Hidden within the forest's depths, this chilling graveyard
    evokes dread and sorrow. Ancient tombstones, moss-covered and tilted, stand sentinel
    over lives long past. Gnarled trees cast sinister shadows under the feeble moonlight,
    and an eerie breeze rustles the underbrush. The scent of decay hangs in the air,
    and fleeting apparitions tease the edges of your vision, vanishing when you attempt
    to focus on them. This place is where life and death blur, leaving an indelible
    mark on all who enter.

    exitDescription: The transition from the sinister graveyard leads back to the
      chilling aura of Green Pass-Deep.
