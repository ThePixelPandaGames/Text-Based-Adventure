  locationDescription: Before you enter Petra, you find yourself in the no-man's-land
    known as Pre-Petra. Desolation and desolation stretch as far as the eye can see,
    with the battlefield bearing the scars of countless conflicts. Broken armor and
    shattered weapons lie as forgotten relics, relics of heroes and battles now relegated
    to history. The weight of tragedy lingers in the solemn silence of this forsaken
    land.
