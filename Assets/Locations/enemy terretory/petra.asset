  locationDescription: As you approach Petra, an imposing stronghold of your enemy,
    an unsettling aura chokes the air. Shadowy spires reach for the heavens, casting
    long, ominous silhouettes across the land. Walls of imposing stone block the
    way, their cruel designs speaking of oppression. It's a place where secrets are
    locked behind fortified doors, and the weight of past battles hangs heavy in
    the air.
